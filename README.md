#SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: MOVIE REVIEW SYSTEM
IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing .This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification . We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

#MODEL
-Logistic Regression
-Naive Bayes
-Support Vector machines(SVM)

#LIBRARIES REQUIRED
-Matplotlib
-Numpy
-Pandas
-Pickle
Seaborn
-Scipy
-NLTK

#RESULTS
We can solve most binary classification problems using a similar strategy.
-after execution :
-Accuracy = 86%
-Precision for negative reviews = 85%
-Precision forpositive reviews = 87%
